This is the code of the paper, "Gradient Balance Prior for Centrosymmetric Cross Point Detection and Localization"
## Introduction
In this paper, we propose a brief centrosymmetric cross point detection and localization method based on our gradient balance piror.

## Centrosymmetric cross point
cross points with centrosymmetry.

## Gradient balance prior and Vanishing power map
Gradient balance prior: the vector sum of the gradients surrounding a centrosymmetric cross point is zero.

Vanishing power map: the vanishing power of the gradients around each pixel.

The whole map V can be calculated by

where Gx, Gy is the gradients, k is a sampling kernel.

a) A checkerboard cross point and its gradient vectors; 
b,c) The response map of vanishing power.

## How to use
For algorithm, run the "example_detection_and_localization.m".

For comparsions in our paper, run the "comparsion_XXX.m"

The rest of the experiment codes will be uploaded within a week (in 2022/11/21).
